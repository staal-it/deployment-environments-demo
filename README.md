# Session on Deploy environments with CI/CD int GitHub
This repository is used for my session on 'Efficient and Secure Software Delivery with Azure Deployment Environments and DevBoxes'.

This repo is a fork of a repo from Microsoft Learn. The original repo can be found [here](Azure-Samples/deployment-environments-cicd-tutorial). I expanded that in several ways:
- Added bicep templates to create a complete environment in Dev Center
- Added a custom image that allows you to use Terraform
- Addded a Bicep example
- Improved the GitHub Actions workflow by adding PR comments etc.
